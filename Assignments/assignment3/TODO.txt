TODO:
- add comment in header describing each class
- add comments describing functions (as needed)
- make README file
- fix UML diagram: List <-> Product relation is not correctly represented
- is basic error-checking being done?



DONE:
- implement print() for each class (except Location, where print() is virtual)
    - done for: StoreLocation, WHLocation, Queue, List, Product, Store
- rename variables across all files (naming convention in assignment instructions are not based on any good conventions)
    - done for: Location, StoreLocation, WHLocation, Queue, List, Product
    - not done for: Store, Control, View -> not my code (provided by instructor)
- re-evaluate virtual functions -> should they be implemented in the base class or child class
    - all of them need to be implemented (differently) in the child classes
- remove debugging
- verify no leaks with valgrind
- change base member variables from private to protected, remove getters/setters,
  re-implement affected functions in derived classes
- find source of uninitialized variable in WHLocation::add
    - it was capacity
