    - done for: StoreLocation, WHLocation, Queue, List, Product
- add comment in header describing each class
- add comments describing functions (as needed)
- make README file
- fix UML diagram: List <-> Product relation is not correctly represented
- re-evaluate virtual functions -> should they be implemented in the base class or child class
- is basic error-checking being done?
- remove debugging
- verify no leaks with valgrind
    - find source of unitilized variable in WHLocation::add



DONE:
- rename variables across all files (naming convention in assignment instructions are not based on any good conventions)
    - done for: Location, StoreLocation, WHLocation, Queue, List, Product
    - not done for: Store, Control, View -> not my code (provided by instructor)
