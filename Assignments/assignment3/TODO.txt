TODO:
- add comment in header describing each class
- add comments describing functions (as needed)
- make README file
- should I change the implementation of getQuantity() in StoreLocation and WHLocation
  - make it virtual in Location class?
- fix UML diagram:
  - List <-> Product relation is not correctly represented
  - remove Queue and List
  - make sure function arguments have correct name


DONE:
- is basic error-checking being done?
  - when typing in console a product that has a space (e.g. AOL cd) program enters infinite loop,
  with option menu printing repeatedly
  Soln: replaced
    cin >> product;
  with
    cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
    getline(cin, product);
  in View::getProduct()
- forward initialization syntax
- implement print() for each class (except Location, where print() is virtual)
    - done for: StoreLocation, WHLocation, Queue, List, Product, Store
- rename variables across all files (naming convention in assignment instructions are not based on any good conventions)
    - done for: Location, StoreLocation, WHLocation, Queue, List, Product
    - not done for: Store, Control, View -> not my code (provided by instructor)
- re-evaluate virtual functions -> should they be implemented in the base class or child class
    - all of them need to be implemented (differently) in the child classes
- remove debugging
- verify no leaks with valgrind
- change base member variables from private to protected, remove getters/setters,
  re-implement affected functions in derived classes
- find source of uninitialized variable in WHLocation::add
    - it was capacity
